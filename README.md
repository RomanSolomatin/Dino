# Dino

Created by Alex Bartlett, Duc Dao, Thomas Franklin, and Khammadao Lee.

_Dino_ is a top-down shooter made in Unreal Engine 4 for [Cal Poly](http://calpoly.edu/)'s Game Design class, CSC 371. You play as Laser Raptor, one of the few dinosaurs who have survived a meteor strike, granting you the ability to shoot laser beams through your eyes. The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible.

_Dino_ was inspired by [Kung Fury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fury).
